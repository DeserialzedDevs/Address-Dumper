# Address-Dumper
An open source ROBLOX address dumper by DeserializedDevs.

Side note: Calling conventions are currently innacurate for [C++ Internal](https://github.com/DeserialzedDevs/Address-Dumper/tree/main/Internal).

Side note 2: Only [C++ Internal](https://github.com/DeserialzedDevs/Address-Dumper/tree/main/Internal) has types. Because deaddlocust is working on the external ones and he is stupid and has no idea how to get types externally. Ikr disgusting.
